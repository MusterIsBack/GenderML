# GenderML
Predict gender based on weight and height with ML

At first, I added Skleran in my library and I used the tree section in this library. 

with '$ pip install -U scikit-learn' you can install sklearn library with PIP. 

After that, I gave the data in advance to the program so that it can determine the gender of the data that the user enters.(user only enter height and weight)

Just as easily. With the help of a Machine Learning. 

Source site for the library: https://scikit-learn.org
